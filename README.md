# Data Analysis Process

### Data Collection

The dataset utilized for analysis was obtained from EskweGifts' comprehensive data warehouse, available at  https://github.com/neisdanica/eskwegifts-data. This repository encompasses detailed records of order history, customer profiles, and item information.

### Data Transformation

Preparing data is crucial before conducting data analysis. This includes data cleaning, such as replacing null values in the Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) column with '0' to avoid affecting other calculations, creating calculated columns for deeper insights, and generating new tables for a more thorough analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was done both using SQL and Looker Studio.
